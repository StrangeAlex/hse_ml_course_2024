Was stressed out when the question was asked, now I'm feeling like talking about games. I care about accuracy of this answer probably way more than you do. This is gonna be juicy...\n\n (++great, you're missing out; +cool)\n\nI play variety of stuff in different genres (recently I finished (not 100%) and enjoyed +Super Meat Boy, not-so recently +Bastion, ++Hotline Miami 1). Some games are just so good that their genre doesn't matter as much to me.\n\nI love to make important decisions when item slots \/ resources are scarce, as in roguelikes. In moments like this, I think to myself, \"that's my game \/ genre!\". And in roguelikes, I don't have to lock-in into one build for extended period of time, as each run is fresh and relatively short. (++FTL \u2248 ++Isaac > ++Downwell > +Dead Cells > Into the Breach > Necrodancer \u2248 Slay the Spire \u2248 Gungeon \u2248 Freeware Spelunky > Convoy \u2248 Organ Trail > Nuclear Throne)\n\nOn the other hand, I don't play RPGs, games which put character progression over player skill. I never did, was afraid of grind. And now I'm also concerned about the time investment required. Games like that I refer to as \"not my genre\" (`not \"my genre\" !== \"not my genre\"`, there's a lot of stuff in between)\n\nThere are some games like that that I intend to play anyway (I heard they're great), mostly Witcher and Nier Automata. Cross Code also looks interesting.\n\nI also refuse to try Factorio, I'm afraid that I'd spend too much time in it. But that might change, I'm learning to take breaks.\n\nAlso, I played a bunch of 4th wall breaking titles (++Undertale >= +DDLC >= +Stanley Parable > Pony Island > One Shot), and now anything like that immediately enters my to-play list (except Evoland, dunno why it doesn't interest me as much).\n\nAlso enjoyed some puzzle games (+Chronotron, +Braid, ++Portal 1, Crazy Machines 1) and intend to play more.","425":"> rice for fish","426":"there have not configure file :(","427":"also you cant initiate conversation from bot to user","428":"Thanks","429":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/yfi8yrP7HnQ","430":"All of them are same, actually u r hiding behind it","431":"Translate this","432":"I guess","433":"it is called: Out-of-Context-Devs or \"Running Wild and Debug Nonsenses\".","434":"That does not answer either of the two questionnsn.","435":"2 word == Dword","436":"I am in love with this thing","437":"In point, what do you think of the distributed internet as an idea?
