Should I load the csv file into code blocks?","967":"I can try to compile it with pgi, but I'm not sure, that I have needed knowlengde for creating makefile for pgi","968":"","969":"```Select-String -Path rsy.for -Pattern 'module'\nSelect-String -Path kreg.for -Pattern 'module'```","970":"","971":"I'm gonna take a look. Of course, there are many different codes that depend on the particles system you wanna study and so on","972":"Ok. But, I prefer CONTINUE :))","973":"5 spaces should be","974":"Well, there is no module either","975":"It is hard to say why.. Check the end of previous subroutine","976":"but what is the purpose of language?","977":"I understood the algorithm for solving the problem. \n But I'm having trouble getting through to do the program.","978":"Haha","979":"I think in LLVM 16 flang should be quite good","980":"for example, for the function y=(x-xi)(x-xj) with xi=2 and xj=1, the output is y= x^2-3x+2","981":"Datamodel and qsort are both modules","982":"there is no such thing as purpose. it's just instrument for  convenient code writing. in general for number crunching code","983":"Might be this is a causes why there is no 11th data in file","984":"It should work:\n```type A\n integer :: t\nend type\n\ntype(A) :: arr(5)\n\nprint *, arr(:)%t```","985":"But if I use this code\n```\ndimension a(40)\ndata a \/40*0\/\nread*, a\nprint*, sum(a)\n```\nI don't control the \/n symbol...","986":"hi","987":"\/languages@rextester_bot","988":"http:\/\/github.com\/romaniukvadim\/ellipsometric-calculator\/blob\/master\/Fortran_version\/gradient\/Gradient4B.for","989":"I mean - lets asuume file have 10 lines, but you have coded somethibg like \nDo i =1,11\nRead ()\nEnd do","990":"Fortran 77 gives a lot of problem","991":"Integers","992":"Yes, I do.","993":"Here, @zx_gamer123","994":"Hello there people","995":"Me too","996":"","997":"Thanks","998":"Sir website url is there","999":"Algu\u00e9m tem c\u00f3digo para Fortran de c\u00e1lculo de meia vida?"}}
