To develop on the ETH blockchain you need to actually build and deploy directly to it, using their interface and compiler or the only aspect of your site that will be blockchain based or oriented will be the smart contracts which is the digitally binding public view hyper ledger entry like a paper trail so to speak.\n\nLike for example the unity games for mobile which feature SOUL erc20 tokens, they are crypto earning games but they are not hosted on ETH blockchain or ecosystem, the only thing blockchain about these apps as they are not dApps is the smart contract between the site\/game for the SOUL erc20 token swap to ETH.","86":"This is the place to ask questions if it's solidity related, if not, you can send me a dm on other language questions","87":"Lol scam token","88":"","89":"and hardcoded owner address \ud83d\ude22","90":"from where?","91":"If you plan to do this decentralized, my idea would be maybe making an option to mark a result as wrong.

Like let's take my example, now all users of B want to punish you, but since A won, noone of A does. However, let's say you enter B as a winner even tho A won. Now you'd have to have some honest A bettors who claim a wrong result and if 51% of the A bets agree on that, all bets get released and you get tokens burned you have to placed up as a security.
